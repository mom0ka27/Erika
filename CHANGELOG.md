# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Custom HTTP headers

- Added `erika_open_with_headers` and `erika_presenter_open_with_headers`,
  which carry caller-supplied headers (`Authorization`, session cookies, …)
  on the `HEAD` probe, every ranged `GET`, and the prefetch thread. The C ABI
  now exports 75 functions.
- `erika_open` and `erika_presenter_open` are unchanged and delegate to the new
  entry points with an empty header list.
- `ErikaPlayer.open` accepts `httpHeaders` on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
  When the loaded native library predates these exports, an open that carries
  headers now fails with an explicit error instead of silently dropping them.
- Headers Erika derives itself (`Range`, `Host`, `Content-Length`,
  `Transfer-Encoding`, `Connection`) are rejected at the ABI boundary, as are
  header names and values that are not valid HTTP field tokens.
- External subtitle and danmaku sidecar loads still use the headerless path;
  they do not yet inherit the request's headers.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-17

### Android playback and packaging

- Added the complete MediaCodec, AHardwareBuffer/wgpu, AAudio, Flutter
  PlatformView, SAF/content-source, subtitle, danmaku, screenshot, SDR/HDR,
  diagnostics, and recovery paths.
- `ERIKA_PREBUILT=1` now stages `liberika_capi.so` and `libc++_shared.so` from
  the tagged Android release archive for the requested Flutter ABIs, with an
  explicit source-build fallback.

### Breaking C API surface-size semantics

The `width` and `height` arguments passed to
`erika_presenter_attach_metal_layer`, `erika_presenter_attach_wgpu_surface`,
`erika_presenter_attach_wgpu_surface_with_output_capabilities`,
`erika_presenter_attach_windows_hwnd`, and `erika_presenter_resize_surface`
now mean the exact drawable extent in physical pixels.

Previously, native renderers multiplied those values by `scale`. The `scale`
argument is now independent and affects logical UI content such as danmaku; it
never changes the surface extent. Direct C API hosts that currently pass logical
dimensions must convert them to physical pixels before calling these functions.
The in-tree macOS, iOS, Windows, and Android Flutter embeddings and examples
have already been updated.

### Playback command dispatch

`play` is queued asynchronously and no longer waits indefinitely for the
playback worker. Hosts must observe `StateChanged` and `Error` events for the
authoritative result of the transition.
