# erika_flutter

Flutter plugin for the Erika media playback engine.

The plugin keeps Dart out of the hot path:

- Dart exposes low-frequency player commands and event streams.
- The native plugins expose two surface strategies: `ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView`
  for the recommended window-hosted overlay path (Metal on macOS/iOS, a D3D11
  swapchain on Windows), and `ErikaVideoView` for platform-view embedding. On
  Android both widgets route through the same native-view selector: SDR uses a
  real `TextureView`, while requested extended-linear output uses a
  `SurfaceView` with Hybrid Composition.
- The macOS plugin loads the Erika dynamic library.
- The iOS plugin links the Erika static library.
- The Windows plugin builds and links the Erika C ABI DLL.
- The Android plugin builds `liberika_capi.so` per ABI and drives its native
  surface from `Choreographer`.
- Erika owns playback, rendering, audio, timing, and overlays through
  `ErikaPresenterHandle`.

## Video Surfaces

Use `ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView` for full-player macOS/iOS UIs. It reserves a
Flutter layout rect while the plugin hosts a sibling native `CAMetalLayer`, so
video stays outside Flutter's platform-view compositor.

On Windows `ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView` hosts a window-level Direct3D 11
swapchain as a sibling surface, following the same overlay model.

Use `ErikaVideoView` when a standard Flutter platform view is required for a
small embedder, compatibility path, or diagnostics.

On Android the SDR video surface is a native `TextureView`. An
`ErikaOutputMode.extendedLinear` player instead creates a `SurfaceView` through
`PlatformViewLink`/Hybrid Composition, because scRGB must bypass Flutter's
texture-layer composition. The plugin forwards the borrowed `Surface` to Erika
and handles creation, resize, destruction, audio focus, HDR eligibility, and
vsync ticks.

## macOS Setup

The macOS plugin's podspec build phase builds the universal
`liberika_capi.dylib` from source (or downloads a prebuilt one — see below) and
bundles it into the app's `Contents/Frameworks`, codesigned, during the macOS
app build. At runtime the plugin loads it via `dlopen`.

Overrides: `ERIKA_CAPI_DYLIB` forces the runtime dylib path; `ERIKA_MACOS_CAPI_DYLIB`
points the build phase at an explicit dylib to bundle instead of building.

## Prebuilt binaries (opt-in)

To skip building Erika (and FFmpeg) from source, set `ERIKA_PREBUILT=1` in the
app build to download the prebuilt `erika_capi` from a GitHub Release
(`ERIKA_PREBUILT_TAG` selects the tag, default `v0.1.3`). Supported on macOS,
Windows, iOS, and Android; any failure falls back to the source build. See
[`docs/releasing.md`](../../docs/releasing.md).

When debugging local Erika source changes, set
`ERIKA_FORCE_SOURCE_BUILD=1` to bypass the prebuilt download path even if the
host app enables `ERIKA_PREBUILT=1`.

## iOS Setup

The iOS CocoaPod script phase builds the Erika native dependencies and C ABI
static library automatically during Xcode builds. Requirements:

- Rust toolchain with the appropriate iOS target (`rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios`)

## Windows Setup

The Windows plugin (`ErikaFlutterPluginCApi`) builds the Erika C ABI runtime
(`erika_capi.dll`) during the CMake build via `build_erika_runtime.cmake`,
invoking cargo for the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target and staging the DLL next
to the app. Requirements:

- Rust toolchain with the MSVC target (`rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)
- Visual Studio Build Tools (MSVC) + Windows SDK
- Native dependencies built into `third_party/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/`
  (via the repo `xtask deps build` flow)

Set `ERIKA_REPO_ROOT` if the plugin cannot locate the Erika checkout
automatically.

## Android Setup

The Android Gradle plugin invokes Erika's `xtask` dependency build and then
builds `erika_capi` with Cargo for the selected ABI. Install the Android NDK and
the corresponding Rust targets. Android API 26 or newer is required. The
generated `jniLibs` include both `liberika_capi.so` and the matching NDK
`libc++_shared.so`. By default arm64 and x86_64 are built; override
this with `-PerikaAndroidAbis=arm64-v8a,x86_64` or `ERIKA_ANDROID_ABIS`.

Android `content://` media and subtitle URIs are opened through
`ContentResolver`, detached, and passed to Erika as owned `fd://` sources with
their provider offset and length.

Android's minimum remains API 26. Extended-linear output additionally needs the
native-window dataspace API (API 28+); API 26/27 continue in SDR and report the
specific fallback. On API 34+, the plugin observes
`Display.registerHdrSdrRatioChangedListener` and publishes real ratio changes
to Erika, allowing wgpu to update subsequent frame targets and output status
without reattaching the surface. On API 35 it also applies per-`SurfaceView`
desired HDR headroom without changing the host window globally.

## HTTP Headers

For HTTP(S) video playback, pass request headers through `httpHeaders`:

```dart
await player.open(
  'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  httpHeaders: <String, String>{
    'Authorization': 'Bearer token',
    'Referer': 'https://example.com/',
  },
);
```

Headers are sent with HEAD, Range GET, and prefetch requests, and only apply to
HTTP(S) URLs. Headers are ignored for `content://` and local-file playback.
Avoid writing sensitive values such as Authorization and Cookie to application
logs.

Headers the playback engine derives itself are rejected instead of merged:
`Range`, `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Transfer-Encoding`, and `Connection`
(case-insensitive) make `open` throw, as do names and values that are not valid
HTTP field tokens. If the bundled native library is a 0.1.3-or-earlier prebuilt
that predates HTTP header support, an `open` that carries headers throws rather
than silently dropping them.

Headers apply to the media source only — external subtitle tracks and danmaku
sidecar files are still fetched without them.

## Output Mode

`ErikaPlayer()` lets the Apple plugins choose SDR or Apple EDR from the current
screen and environment; Android defaults to SDR. To force Apple EDR from Dart:

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(
  outputMode: ErikaOutputMode.appleEdr,
  edrHeadroom: 4.0,
);
```

Use `ErikaOutputMode.sdr` to force SDR output.

Android's high-headroom mode is FP16 **extended-linear scRGB**, not HDR10/PQ:

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(
  outputMode: ErikaOutputMode.extendedLinear,
  edrHeadroom: 4.0,
);
```

`edrHeadroom` is a content-headroom ceiling. If it is omitted for an
extended-linear player, Erika uses a 4x content ceiling while the
`SurfaceView` receives desired headroom `0` (system auto). An explicit value is
also applied as the per-`SurfaceView` desired headroom on API 35. The current
display HDR/SDR ratio, when available, further bounds the effective wgpu target.

The mode activates only when all of these hold: the display/surface is
HDR-capable, the view is a Hybrid-Composition `SurfaceView`, wgpu selected
Vulkan, the surface exposes `Rgba16Float`, and the configured native window
reads back `ADATASPACE_SCRGB_LINEAR` (`406913024`, `0x18410000`). GLES,
`TextureView`, missing FP16 support, and dataspace failures explicitly fall
back to SDR. Android scRGB uses BT.709 primaries with `1.0 = 80 nit`; it does
not use PQ or HDR10 metadata.

Always query the negotiated state instead of trusting the request:

```dart
final status = await player.getOutputStatus();
if (!status.extendedLinearActive) {
  debugPrint(
    'Erika output fallback: '
    '${status.fallbackReason.label} (${status.fallbackReason.nativeValue})',
  );
}
```

`ErikaOutputStatus` contains 13 fields: `requestedMode`, `activeEncoding`,
`surfaceFormat`, `nativeDataSpace`, `requestedHeadroom`, `activeHeadroom`,
`activeHeadroomKnown`, `extendedLinearActive`, `fallbackReason`,
`fallbackCount`, `dataSpaceFailures`, `headroomUpdates`, and
`extendedLinearFrames`. Active Android scRGB is
`androidExtendedLinearScRgb + sixteenBitFloat + nativeDataSpace 406913024`.
On API 34+, `activeHeadroom` is the current display HDR/SDR ratio and
`activeHeadroomKnown` is true when Android exposes a valid ratio. If the ratio
is unavailable, the value is only a fallback and `activeHeadroomKnown` is
false. `headroomUpdates` increments only when the known state or ratio really
changes; duplicate listener notifications are ignored.

`ErikaOutputFallbackReason` values are stable ABI codes:

| Code | Dart value | Stable label |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 0 | `none` | `none` |
| 1 | `displayHdrUnsupported` | `display_hdr_unsupported` |
| 2 | `hybridCompositionRequired` | `hybrid_composition_required` |
| 3 | `wgpuBackendNotVulkan` | `wgpu_backend_not_vulkan` |
| 4 | `rgba16FloatSurfaceFormatUnavailable` | `rgba16float_surface_format_unavailable` |
| 5 | `nativeWindowDataSpaceApiUnavailable` | `native_window_dataspace_api_unavailable` |
| 6 | `scrgbDataSpaceVerificationFailed` | `scrgb_dataspace_verification_failed` |
| 7 | `surfaceConfigureFailed` | `surface_configure_failed` |
| 8 | `legacyAppleEdrUnsupported` | `legacy_apple_edr_unsupported` |

`player.screenshot()` returns raw SDR RGBA8 for the current composited frame
(video + subtitle + danmaku), even when the display is Apple EDR or Android
extended-linear. Metal and Android/wgpu implement capture; the current Windows
D3D11 Flutter path does not return screenshot bytes.

Non-HDR emulator/device coverage verifies the explicit SDR fallback and its
reason. Active extended-linear output is not yet claimed as device-validated;
acceptance still requires an API 35 HDR device with `Rgba16Float +
SCRGB_LINEAR`, live HDR/SDR-ratio updates, rotation/background recovery,
multiple players, and SDR screenshot checks.

## Upscaler

Select ArtCNN at creation time, or switch it later at runtime:

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(upscaler: ErikaUpscalerMode.artCnnC4F16);
await player.setUpscaler(ErikaUpscalerMode.artCnnC4F16);
```

Use `ErikaUpscalerMode.off` to disable it. Call
`player.getUpscalerStatus()` to inspect the requested mode, active backend,
fallback count, upscaled frame count, and recent GPU timings. Apple uses Metal;
Android uses wgpu/Vulkan compute for both planar and MediaCodec Surface frames.
GLES 3.0 keeps normal playback and reports an explicit `inactive` fallback.
